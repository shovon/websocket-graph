# Path Emergence Logic: Stateless

This memo specifies a source-routed delivery discipline for a directed,
strongly-connected network of autonomous nodes. Under it, the origin holds the
complete route to a destination and stamps it onto every packet; intermediate
nodes are pure forwarders that retain no routing state.

The network model it assumes:

- **Directed and strongly-connected.** Every node can reach every other node, but
  not necessarily by a symmetric link.
- **Forward-only sends.** A node addresses only its _out-neighbors_, each named by
  a local _out-edge designator_. It is never told its in-neighbors and can never
  reply directly to one.
- **Locally-scoped designators.** A designator is meaningful only to the node that
  holds it. The same value may appear at two unrelated nodes and point to
  different targets; a node that leaves and reconnects is issued a _new_
  designator.
- **Globally unique node IDs**, derived independently of designators and not
  interchangeable with them.
- **No sender identity from the wire.** A receiver learns who sent a packet only
  by reading its contents.

Cycle detection, flood termination, and the heuristic applied when a cycle is
detected are specified in the cycle-detection memo and are referenced here, not
re-derived. Wherever this document relies on duplicate suppression or
loop-checking, it defers to that memo and notes the plug-in point.

## The axiom: the origin always carries the full path

A path is built end to end and **lives at the origin**. On every send, the origin
stamps the complete route — the ordered list of `(node ID, out-designator)` pairs
from itself to the target — into the packet header. Each hop reads the one
designator that belongs to it, forwards, and advances a pointer. Nothing about
forwarding requires an intermediate to remember anything.

The reason the origin must hold the _whole_ route, every time, is a deliberate
worst-case assumption: **intermediate nodes are presumed not to remember the
path.** Erring on the side of caution, the origin never relies on any downstream
node retaining state. If an intermediate happens to know the remainder of the
path, that fact is used only to _shorten discovery_ (see below) — never as a
substitute for the origin carrying the route. The origin's copy is the single
authoritative copy.

This is the natural fit for locally-scoped designators. A trail is forward-only
and each designator is interpretable only by its owner, so a source route works
precisely because every hop reads its own entry in sequence. The origin embedding
the full route is not a workaround; it is the most honest expression of the
constraint.

### What the discipline buys and costs

- **Route state lives at the origin, and nowhere else.** Intermediates hold no
  forwarding state, so there is nothing in the interior of the network to go stale
  as the topology churns.
- **Staleness is concentrated and visible.** When a route dies, the whole route is
  dead at once, held in one place, and discovered on the next send — there is no
  silent, partial, hop-by-hop rot to chase down.
- **The header grows with path length.** Every packet carries the entire route.
  This is the price paid for stateless intermediates and is the main quantity to
  watch as paths lengthen.
- **The origin must be told when a route breaks**, because it is the only party
  holding the route and the only one that can refresh it.

## Flood Find

When the origin wants to deliver cargo to a target node ID it does not yet have a
route for, it floods the cargo to its out-neighbors, appending its
`(node ID, out-designator)` entry to each copy. Every intermediate appends its own
entry as it re-floods, so the route grows one pair per hop. Flood termination — a
discovery ID that each node remembers-and-drops on repeat, plus a TTL backstop —
is required for correctness on a cyclic graph and is specified in the
cycle-detection memo.

### Early termination via a remembered suffix

If a node recognizes the target — it _is_ the target, or it still holds a
remembered suffix toward the target — discovery stops there. This **answering
node** assembles the full route: the discovered prefix `(origin → answerer)`
followed by the suffix `(answerer → target)`. This is the only use of intermediate
memory in the design, and it accelerates _discovery_ only, never _forwarding_. The
assembled suffix may be stale; loop-checking the concatenated node-ID list and
revalidating stale suffixes is the plug-in point for the cycle-detection memo.

### Returning the assembled route to the origin

The answering node delivers the complete assembled route back to the origin's node
ID. This return is a _delivery_, not a reverse traversal: trails are forward-only,
so if the answering node has no route to the origin, the return is itself a flood
find. Budget the common case at two floods. The return terminates in one shot —
its target is the origin, which is the endpoint — and should install origin-ward
state as it travels, so the answering node can answer cheaply next time.

### Filing the route at the origin

When the origin receives the assembled route, it simply files it in its own route
cache against the target's node ID. There is **no hop-by-hop install**: nothing is
written into the interior of the network, and there is no install walk that can
break or partially complete. The next packet to that target carries the route in
its header, and every intermediate forwards by reading its own entry.

---

## Forwarding a source-routed packet

The header carries the ordered route plus a position pointer. A node that receives
a source-routed packet:

1. Reads the current entry — its own `(node ID, out-designator)` — and forwards
   along that designator.
2. Advances the pointer so the next hop reads the next entry.

Node IDs in the header are not strictly required for plain forwarding (a node can
just read "the next designator"), but they are carried because they enable two
things: loop and duplicate validation (the plug-in point for the cycle memo), and
**local repair targeting** (below). Because the header carries _global_ node IDs,
any hop can name any downstream node even though designators are local.

---

## Broken Trail

A hop may find its out-designator dead — typically because the next node moved and
was re-issued a designator, or because the edge itself failed. The handling here
assumes failures are **loud**: a send on a dead designator returns a local error.
If sends fail silently, no hop can detect a break and the only recovery is an
origin-side timeout and re-find.

Given loud failures, there are two strategies, differing in how much cleverness an
intermediate is permitted.

### Default: re-find via the origin

Consistent with the axiom that the origin owns the path, the simplest handling is:
the breaking node notifies the origin (a delivery to the origin's node ID — a
flood find if it has no cached route there), the origin discards the stale route,
re-runs flood find, and resends with a fresh full route. Intermediates stay dumb.
The cost is a reverse flood plus a fresh find, but no interior state is touched and
there is no partial-install hazard.

### Optimization: local splice (must still report to the origin)

Because the header carries the next hop's _node ID_, the breaking node X can
attempt to repair in place: flood-find a fresh route to the successor's node ID,
prepend it, and continue with the original suffix unchanged. This is sound **only
when the break is the edge into the successor, not churn of the successor
itself.** If the successor moved and was re-issued designators, the suffix entries
it owns are also stale and the splice will deliver into a dead route — fall back to
origin re-find.

Even when a local splice succeeds, the breaking node should still notify the
origin so the origin can update its authoritative copy. Otherwise the invariant —
_the origin always holds the current full path_ — is violated, and the origin will
keep stamping the stale route on subsequent packets. The splice rescues the packet
in flight; the notification preserves the design.

---

## Notifying the origin

Because the origin is the sole holder of the route and the only party that can
refresh it, notification is close to mandatory. Every notification is a delivery to
the origin's node ID — a reverse flood in the worst case — so it carries a real
cost, but the origin cannot function without it.

- **Drop, or break with no repair.** Notify. The origin cannot otherwise learn its
  cached route is dead, and an origin-side timeout alone wastes a full retry on a
  route already known to be broken.
- **Local splice succeeded.** Notify anyway — not to recover the packet, but to
  keep the origin's authoritative route current (see above).
- **Find succeeded (the normal case).** The return of the assembled route _is_ the
  notification; nothing additional is needed.

---

## State and overhead

- **Intermediate state: ideally none.** Pure forwarders. An intermediate may
  _optionally_ cache suffixes to speed future discovery, but the design never
  depends on it, and such caches are pure optimization that may be dropped at any
  time.
- **Origin state: one full route per destination it talks to.** Concentrated and
  visible. When it goes stale, the whole route is stale at once, discovered on the
  next send.
- **Header overhead: O(path length) per packet.** Every packet carries the entire
  route. This is the dominant cost and the main thing to watch as paths get long.

---

## Open issues and standing assumptions

- **Header size is the dominant cost.** Long paths mean large headers on every
  packet. If paths can be long, one mitigation is a hybrid that carries the full
  route only until the first successful delivery, after which intermediates _may_
  cache and the origin _may_ fall back to a shorter destination-keyed header. That
  reintroduces distributed per-hop soft state and the silent staleness that comes
  with it, abandoning this design's central virtue — so adopt it only as a
  deliberate trade, not by accident.
- **The origin is a concentration point.** It holds and must refresh every route it
  uses. This is simpler to reason about than distributed soft state, but it makes
  the origin's route cache the thing that determines reachability.
- **Trust.** The origin trusts any assembled suffix it is handed, and any hop
  trusts the header it is given. Source identity is still only what the packet
  claims; on an untrusted network, route entries and assembled suffixes need
  authentication, or a malicious answering node can hand the origin a poisoned
  route.
- **Destination-side dedup.** Flooding during discovery (and retries) can deliver
  duplicates; deduplicate at the destination on `(origin ID, message sequence)`.
- **Termination and loops.** Flood termination, the loop-check on remembered
  suffixes, and all cycle handling live in the cycle-detection memo and are assumed
  available wherever referenced here.
