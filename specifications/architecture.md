# Graph Relay System (GRS) Protocol

## Status of This Memo

This document is an informational specification for a Graph Relay System (GRS) protocol. It describes an aspirational architecture for a centralized server-based system that maintains a graph of connected clients. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

This document does not specify a standard for the Internet community but provides a framework to inspire further development and refinement by interested parties. Implementers are encouraged to derive their own detailed specifications based on this high-level outline.

## Abstract

The Graph Relay System (GRS) is a conceptual protocol for a client-server architecture where a central server maintains an internal directed graph representing connected clients as nodes. The server ensures reachability among all nodes, facilitating indirect communication through graph traversal while restricting direct interactions to neighboring nodes. This document outlines the core principles and requirements without prescribing implementation details, aiming to foster innovation in graph-based relay systems.

## 1. Introduction

Modern networked applications often require efficient, structured communication among participants. Traditional client-server models excel in centralized control but may lack flexibility in representing complex relationships. The Graph Relay System (GRS) proposes an architecture where a server maintains a dynamic directed graph of client nodes, enabling reachability and neighbor-based interactions.

This protocol is aspirational, focusing on high-level concepts to guide the creation of practical implementations. It assumes a client-server medium for core operations but allows for flexibility in derivative works. The goal is to ensure that all nodes are mutually reachable, with changes propagated promptly, while direct communication is limited to graph neighbors.

This document does not mandate specific transport mechanisms, data formats, or algorithms, leaving such details to implementers.

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- **Server**: The central entity that maintains the graph and manages client connections.
- **Client**: An entity connected to the server, represented as a node in the graph.
- **Node**: A representation of a client within the server's internal graph.
- **Neighborhood**: The set of nodes directly connected (via directed edges) to a given node.
- **Reachability**: The property that there exists a path from any node to any other node in the graph.
- **Graph**: A directed graph maintained by the server, where nodes correspond to clients and edges define direct communication allowances.

## 3. Architecture Overview

GRS operates in a client-server model where clients connect to a single server. Each active connection establishes a node in the server's internal directed graph. The server is responsible for constructing and maintaining this graph such that it remains connected, ensuring reachability from any node to any other.

An example topology is a directed cycle (n-cycle ring) where n is the number of nodes, providing basic reachability. However, the server MAY use more efficient topologies, such as those with lower diameter, as long as reachability is preserved.

The architecture MUST be implemented over a client-server medium, such as session-oriented protocols. This ensures centralized control and simplifies graph management.

## 4. Server Responsibilities

The server acts as the authoritative maintainer of the graph. It MUST:

- Accept connections from clients and represent each as a unique node.
- Construct and dynamically update the graph to ensure full reachability among all nodes.
- Handle additions, removals, or modifications of nodes (e.g., due to client disconnections or topology optimizations).
- Propagate changes to affected clients in a timely manner.
- Facilitate message relay between neighboring nodes without allowing direct non-neighbor interactions.

The server SHOULD aim for efficiency in graph maintenance but is not required to optimize for specific metrics like latency or bandwidth.

## 5. Client Capabilities and Constraints

Clients interact solely with the server and, through it, with their graph neighbors. Clients:

- MUST establish a connection to the server to join the graph.
- SHOULD be prepared to receive updates about neighborhood changes.

Clients MAY:

- Request the current state of their neighborhood from the server.
- Send messages to any neighbor via the server.
- Receive messages from neighbors via the server.

Clients MUST NOT:

- Communicate directly with non-neighboring nodes without server mediation.
- Attempt to modify the graph structure themselves; all changes are server-initiated.

## 6. Change Notification and State Management

When a node's neighborhood changes (e.g., due to new connections, disconnections, or topology adjustments), the server SHOULD notify the affected node(s) as soon as the change is committed. This ensures eventual consistency across clients.

Clients SHOULD be able to query the server for their current neighborhood state at any time. The server MUST respond accurately, reflecting the latest graph configuration.

No specific mechanism for notifications or queries is prescribed; implementers are free to choose polling, push notifications, or other methods.

## 7. Communication Rules

Communication in GRS is graph-constrained:

- Direct messaging is permitted only between neighboring nodes, relayed through the server.
- Messages to non-neighbors MAY be achieved via multi-hop traversal (e.g., routing along graph paths), but such routing protocols are beyond the scope of this document and MUST be defined in companion specifications.

This restriction encourages structured, topology-aware interactions while leveraging the server's central role for enforcement.

## 8. Extensibility and Derivatives

This specification focuses on the core client-server paradigm. Derivative specifications MAY extend GRS to non-client-server mediums (e.g., peer-to-peer overlays) as long as the central graph maintenance and reachability principles are upheld. However, core implementations MUST adhere to the client-server model to preserve simplicity and control.

Implementers are encouraged to develop detailed protocols, including transport bindings, message formats, and error handling, to realize GRS in practice.

## 9. Security Considerations

GRS assumes a trusted server, as it holds authoritative control over the graph. Potential risks include:

- Server compromise, leading to graph manipulation or message interception.
- Client spoofing, where unauthorized entities join as nodes.
- Denial-of-service attacks targeting the server or specific nodes.

Implementations SHOULD incorporate authentication, encryption, and access controls. However, specific security mechanisms are left to derivative specifications.

## 10. IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
